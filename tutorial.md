<!-- This is an example of how I have written tutorials across various roles. For this document, I created a basic website after completing the "Complete Intro to Web Development, v3" by Brian Holt on frontendmasters.com and documented my own process as a tutorial. I aim to provide an entry-level experience while guiding towards further development. -->

# How to Create a Basic Website - WIP

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a basic website from scratch. This is only one example and by no means comprehensive, but it will give you a good insight into the different processes and requirements involved.

Building your own webpages is a hugely rewarding process and is a good way to learn about coding and web development in general.

## Before We Get Started

As much as we would like you to be able to immediately jump in and start working there are some important ideas we need to explore before we write our first line of code. 

Our webpage is composed of three key elements:
- **HTML**: a structured language used to build the physical webpage
- **CSS**: a supplementary set of instructions to style the HTML and define the appearance of the page
- **JavaScript**: a programming language used to build the interactive elements we will incorporate into the webpage

A simple way to understand how these three elements work together is like a film or tv show: HTML builds the set, CSS provides paint and costumes, and JavaScript tells the actors exactly what to do.

We will provide the specific instructions needed to employ each of these elements as we go, but you may find it easier to progress or understand each step if you already have some familiarity with these concepts. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of any website so expanding your knowledge will help you in the future as you work on your own projects.

Some free resources you can use are:

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)

The following sites provide more in-depth teaching but require a subscription:

- [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

Additionally, we are going to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store all of our work. Our website will be made up of several different files so organising and protecting them is essential. This is not required for this tutorial but you may find it useful - and certainly useful for future projects! GitHub is a **source control** system which offers two important features, among many:

- **Cloud-based data storage**: your work is safe from any problems with your local machine!
- **Version control**: revisit earlier versions of your work if you've taken a wrong turn.

Work is uploaded, or 'pushed', to GitHub using commands entered into a program with a command line interface, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [GitBash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash). Commands are written in a language called **Git** and it may seem difficult for a first-time user to understand. GitHub itself also requires some set-up so you will need to complete all of the necessary steps before we begin.

You can learn about GitHub and the Git language from any of the sites linked earlier. You can also learn from GitHub directly at: [GitHub - Get  Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

There are plenty of other source control services available so feel free to explore alternatives that better suit you.

With all of that out of the way, lets begin our journey towards our first webpage!

## Overview

We are going to create a website with an interactive word-finding game, much like **Wordle** and its many imitators. This will involve building a simple webpage to host the JavaScript tool that comprises the word-finding game itself. You may remember that the original Wordle game was developed by one man as a side project for his partner and quickly became a worldwide phenomenon!

We will follow this basic journey:

1. Build our HTML framework
2. Style our HTML using CSS
3. Build our game using JavaScript and then incorporate it into our HTML

By the end we will have our complete, albeit basic, website. Feel free to expand on this example and experiment however you like once you have finished.
